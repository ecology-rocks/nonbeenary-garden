Welcome to my art repository! If you're familiar with my brand, you may know that I used to manufacture my own pins, magnets, and stickers. Because of the relatively low volume of sales, I decided to switch to fully print-on-demand through TeePublic and Redbubble, with occasional submissions to alternative sites like Spoonflower.

On this website, you'll find much of my art with links to where you can buy it. If you don't find a product you want, or want to order custom prints, please just reach out to sam at nonbeenary.com and I'll get you hooked up. 

I'll also be building a blog reflecting on my past art projects, both good and bad, and maybe even revisiting and improving some old pieces that I have.

Thanks for visiting! Visit the [[art/art\|art]] landing page to see all my designs.
