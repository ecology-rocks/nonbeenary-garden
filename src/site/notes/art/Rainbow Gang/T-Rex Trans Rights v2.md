When I first started out drawing digital art, I wanted to draw the slightly absurd things that came to my mind. This was one of them. 

I drew this piece in September 2020, right before we moved back to Ohio. I don't remember which program I used, but I saved it as a PSD so my guess is that I was still on Photoshop back then. The shadows on the flag were really important to me.
